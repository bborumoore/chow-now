## Description
Chow Now brings busy "Hangry" users together in one app to order meals, pay for those meals, and have those meals delivered to you without having to leave your current location. Chow Now is geared towawrd business settings where multiple people leave for lunch and sometimes all end up at the same location. Chow Now gives user the experience as a "Member" or a "Runner". Members join a like minded group of individuals to order food from the same location. The designated "Runner" then uses the app to go and retrieve those orders and then deliver them to a centralized location at the business location where all Memebers meet to gather their food order. The Runner also has the ability to see who has paid, who still might owe money for an incorrect.adjusted amount, and who has yet to pay in full. The Chow Now app will centralize food orders and save businesses time, money, and resources by allowing team members to work more efficently and be more punctual when going to,returning from breaks.
